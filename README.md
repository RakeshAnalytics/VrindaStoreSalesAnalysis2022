# Introduction
In this project, I have created an annual sales report for Vrinda Stores for 2022 using Excel. The goal was to analyze sales trends and customer behavior to provide insights that will help Vrinda Stores make informed decisions and boost sales in 2023.

## Dataset

The dataset contains order details such as customer demographics, sales channels, product categories, and shipping locations. Key columns include:
 Order ID
 Customer ID
 Gender
 Age
 Category
 Amount
Ship State

## Visualizations

The project includes various insights, visualized through charts and graphs, such as:
 Orders vs Sales by month
 Sales: Men vs Women
 Top 5 States contributing to sales
 Age and Gender-wise order analysis
 Channel-wise order contribution

 ## Key Insights
 **Women** are more likely to purchase (65% of orders).
 The top contributing states are **Maharashtra**, **Karnataka**, and **Uttar Pradesh**.
 The **adult age group (30-49 years)** contributes to 50% of the sales.
 **Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra** are the leading sales channels.

 ## Conclusion
To improve sales, Vrinda Store should target women customers aged 30-49 living in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh by offering ads and coupons on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.
